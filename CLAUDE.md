# Castle Fun Center - Pause Group Automation

## Project Overview
Self-hosted, framework-free pause-group automation for Castle Fun Center (arcade/entertainment venue). Automates pausing/unpausing of CenterEdge games AND kiosks via recurring time windows, overrides, manual actions, and multi-tier enforcement. Pause groups can mix games and kiosks; kiosks also have a standalone management page.

## Architecture
- **Backend:** Pure PHP 7.4+ (no Composer, no frameworks). SQLite database with WAL mode.
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript SPA with hash-based routing. No build step, no npm.
- **External API:** CenterEdge Card System API (REST, SHA-1 auth, bearer token caching).

## Key Files
- `index.php` — Main router: SPA shell, API dispatch, safety nets (Tier 1/2 enforcement)
- `config.php` — Constants: encryption key, DB path, session lifetime, API timeouts
- `cron.php` — Daily cron (00:05): game sync, plan day, queue `at` jobs, purge old data
- `cron_watchdog.php` — Per-minute watchdog: missed actions, state enforcement, re-queue
- `run_action.php` — Single-action executor invoked by `at` jobs
- `lib/scheduler.php` — Core scheduling engine (plan, execute, enforce, resolve conflicts)
- `lib/centeredge_client.php` — CenterEdge API client (auth, games, kiosks, capabilities, pagination, retry)
- `lib/db.php` — SQLite singleton, schema init, query helpers (`:p0` positional params)
- `lib/auth.php` — Session management (bcrypt, HttpOnly, SameSite, 2h timeout, rate limiting)
- `lib/csrf.php` — CSRF token generation + timing-safe validation
- `lib/crypto.php` — AES-256-CBC encrypt-then-MAC (HMAC-SHA256, backward-compatible)
- `lib/validator.php` — Input validation (strings, ints, dates, times, enums, arrays)

## Directory Layout
```
api/          — API endpoint handlers (auth, settings, games, cards, groups, kiosks, schedules, overrides, analytics, logs, users, capabilities)
lib/          — 7 core libraries
public/js/    — Vanilla JS modules (api, app, login, dashboard, games, cards, groups, kiosks, schedules, overrides, analytics, performance, logs, settings)
public/css/   — Dark/light theme stylesheet
data/         — Runtime: SQLite DB, locks, heartbeats, logs (gitignored)
docs/         — Internal docs: security audit, CenterEdge API reference (HTML + OpenAPI YAML)
```

## Development Notes

### Database
- SQLite with WAL mode, foreign keys enabled, 30s busy timeout
- Parameterized queries use positional `:p0, :p1, ...` placeholders
- Schema auto-initializes on first DB access (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS)
- Migrations via ALTER TABLE in try/catch for backward compat

### Reporting & Analytics
- Raw play feed (`game_play_transactions`) is a short rolling window (30 days)
  for the live feed, per-game drill-downs, and hourly reporting.
- `Scheduler::rollupDailyStats()` (run nightly by `cron.php` BEFORE the purge)
  aggregates the raw feed into the permanent per-game, per-day `game_daily_stats`
  table, so month/year performance history survives indefinitely. CenterEdge has
  no reporting API — all aggregation is done locally.
- Reporting endpoints (`GET /api/analytics/games`, `GET /api/analytics/game`)
  stitch the rollup (older days) with the raw feed (recent days) at a split
  point safely inside raw retention, so totals are correct AND live. Same
  `analytics` role gate + cash/revenue scrub the Analytics page uses (tech sees
  plays/tickets, never dollars). Powers the Performance page
  (Day/Week/Month/Year/Custom, searchable, with prior-period comparison).

### API Pattern
- API handlers are loaded via `require_once` from `index.php` which pre-loads `db.php`, `auth.php`, `csrf.php`, `crypto.php`
- Each handler is a function `handleX($method, $parts, $input)` dispatched from `index.php`
- `$parts` = URL segments after the resource name
- `$input` = parsed JSON body for POST/PUT/PATCH
- RuntimeException → 422, other Exception → 500

### Frontend Pattern
- Routes registered via `App.registerRoute('#/path', { render: fn })`
- API calls via `API.get()`, `API.post()`, `API.put()`, `API.patch()`, `API.del()`
- Note: DELETE method uses `API.del()` (not `API.delete()` — `delete` is a JS reserved word)
- DOM built with `App.el(tag, props, children)` helper

### Scheduling Engine
- Schedule windows = active (unpaused) hours. Outside windows = paused.
- Priority: manual override > schedule override > recurring schedule
- `planDay()` computes transition points, resolves conflicts, deduplicates
- Missed-action optimization: only latest per group executed, earlier superseded (status 3)
- Concurrency via ONE global scheduler lock (`Scheduler::acquireLock()/releaseLock()`,
  re-entrant per process). cron.php, cron_watchdog.php, run_action.php AND the web
  entry points (manual actions, per-request enforcement) all take it — never
  fopen/flock LOCK_FILE directly. The watchdog holds it only for its action
  phase and releases before the slow transaction poll.
- `executeStateChange()` patches both games AND kiosks for a group in one
  invocation — kiosks share the GameOperationStatus enum (enabled/paused/outOfService).
  Kiosk patching is best-effort; failure does not roll back game changes.
- Per the kiosk API spec, kiosks reporting no `operationStatus` ("unknown")
  must NOT be pause-controlled — the scheduler skips them automatically.

### Security
- Passwords: bcrypt cost 12, auto-rehash
- CSRF: 256-bit token, `X-CSRF-Token` header, timing-safe validation
- Encryption at rest: AES-256-CBC + HMAC-SHA256 for API credentials
- CLI-only guards on cron scripts
- Input validation via Validator class (throws RuntimeException)
- Roles are DATA (the `roles` table, edited via /api/roles + Settings UI);
  permissions are CODE (`Auth::PERMISSIONS` catalog — 9 keys incl.
  view_revenue, manual_control). `Auth::hasPermission()/canAccess()` resolve
  through the user's role; admin bypasses and is locked against edit/delete.
  The client gets the resolved permission list injected into
  `APP_CONFIG.user.permissions` (and login/status responses) —
  `App.canAccess()` reads it (LEGACY_ACCESS fallback for stale sessions).
  Non-admins can only assign roles whose permissions are a subset of their
  own (`Auth::canAssignRole`). Unknown role slugs resolve to ZERO permissions.
- Sessions re-validate role + is_active from the DB every ~60s, so role
  changes / deactivation / deletion apply without waiting for re-login.
- Admin accounts can only be modified/deleted by admins; last-admin
  demotion/deactivation/deletion is blocked. Card PIN checks are
  audit-logged and rate-limited (15 / 10 min per user).

### Testing
- No automated test suite
- Manual smoke testing via install.php, cron.php, UI flows
- `php -l` for syntax checking across all PHP files

### Running Locally
```bash
php -S localhost:8080 index.php   # Built-in PHP server
# Or with Apache: .htaccess handles URL rewriting
```

### Cron Setup
```bash
* * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/cron_watchdog.php >> /path/to/data/watchdog.log 2>&1
5 0 * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/cron.php >> /path/to/data/cron.log 2>&1
```
